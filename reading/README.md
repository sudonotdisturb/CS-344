# Active Reading notebooks

This is the place to put the notebooks you made while doing active reading on the book chapters. Use the notebook names from the `fastbook` repo for corresponding chapters.

A reminder of what *active reading* is (originally posted on Piazza):

-   Use the "clean" notebooks in <https://github.com/kcarnold/fastbook>

-   Write a quick summary of the main point of each section

-   Write a quick summary of the purpose of each block of code

-   Retype the code yourself. Choose your preferred approach for each code block:

    -   *Minimum approach*: retype the code while looking at it.
    -   *Top-down approach*: write the overall outline of the code, fill in as many details as you can from memory, then peek.
    -   *Bottom-up approach*: as you build up the code, try out each piece to see what it does.
